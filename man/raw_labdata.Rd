Example line list of new lab results that need to be bulk-imported to
Go.Data. This data can be used as base data with \code{match_cases()} to
demonstrate how to link new lab results with existing cases in Go.Data and
create new lab records.  Note that this is not real data; it has been
created for the purpose of demonstration only.

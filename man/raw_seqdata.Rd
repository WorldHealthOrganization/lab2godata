Example line list of whole genome sequencing results that need to be
bulk-imported to Go.Data in order to update existing lab records that only
have the primary diagnostic test result. This data can be used as base data
with \code{match_cases()} to demonstrate how to link sequencing data with existing
lab results in Go.Data and update the lab records.  Note that this is not
real data; it has been created for the purpose of demonstration only.

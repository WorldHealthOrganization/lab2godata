Example line list of cases exported from Go.Data with patient identifying
columns. This data can be used as a reference (look-up) table with
\code{match_cases()} to demonstrate how to link new lab results with existing
cases in Go.Data and create new lab records. Note that this is not real data;
it has been created for the purpose of demonstration only.

Example line list of lab results exported from Go.Data with patient and lab
record identifying columns. This data can be used as a reference (look-up)
table with \code{match_cases()} to demonstrate how to link new information with
existing lab results and update the lab records in Go.Data.  Note that this
is not real data; it has been created for the purpose of demonstration only.
